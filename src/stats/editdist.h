/* Computes the Levenshtein distance between two sequences.
 * 
 * Calculates the minimum number of single-token edits (insertions, 
 * deletions, or substitutions) required to change one sequence into the other.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   p - a sequence of token predictions
 *   m - length of sequence pointed by p
 *   t - a sequence of true tokens
 *   n - length of sequence pointed by t
 *
 * Returns:
 *   The edit distance between the two sequences.
