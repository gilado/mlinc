/* Calculates the mean and standard deviation of an array of feature vectors 
 * by feature (i.e., by column) and returns these values in mean and sdev 
 * vectors respectively.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   x        - Array of M vectors, each having D elements
 *   M        - Number of vectors in x
 *   D        - Number of elements in each vector 
 *   mean     - Returns a vector of D or D-1 values, each is the mean of 
 *              the values of the corresponding column in x array
 *   sdev     - Returns a vector of D or D-1 values, each is the standard 
 *              deviation from the mean of the corresponding column in x array
 *   exc_last - If not 0, the last column of x (i.e., last element of vectors)
 *              is excluded from the calculation. In that case, mean and sdev
 *              have D-1 elements.
 * 
 * This function calculates element-wise mean and standard deviation for all 
 * feature vectors in the dataset passed in x[][], and returns those mean and 
 * standard deviation arrays. The calculation excludes the last column in x[][]
 * (the bias) if exc_last is not zero.
