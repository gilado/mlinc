/* Constructs a processor that normalizes features by scaling them to have
 * a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. It accepts an array of data 
 * consiting of m vectors, each having n elements, or features, and normalizes
 * the data in place. It operates in one of two modes:
 *
 *   In standard mode, it either first calculates mean and variance for
 *   the data, stores it, then normalizes the data using the stored values; 
 *   or it uses previously stored mean and variance to normalize the data.
 *
 *   In batch mode, it either first calculates mean and variance for
 *   the data, updates its internally stored moving averages of these values,
 *   then normalizes the data using the stored value; or it uses previously
 *   stored mean and variance to normalize the data.
 *
 * - if batch is not zero, operate in batch mode.
 * - dim is the dimension of the samples, that is, the number of elements
 *   in each sample vector, the number of columns in the data array.
 * - if exc_last is not zero, the last dimension, that is, the last element
 *   of the sample vectors, the last column of the data array, is not scaled:
 *   mean and variance are not calculated for it, and it is not normalized.
 *
 * Returns a SCALER structure that keeps the scaler's state and is passed
 * to other scaler functions.
